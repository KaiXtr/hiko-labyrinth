# hiko-labyrinth
 My first game ever made

You control a weird little fella called Hiko, and together with Niko, this duo work together in the E.E.E.L.D.H ( Hiko's Labyrintic Special Space Station ), a space station made to protect the Earth from alien invasions. But suddenly the Alien Mafia invades the E.E.E.L.D.H and they want some humans as slaves, so you have to go through 8 levels to fight Blackhead, the evil guy.

To play, press W,A,S and D to move around, G to place bombs to destroy bricks that block your path and H to shoot blue bubbles and beat the hell out of those aliens. To pass a level, you need to walk though the floor of the labyrinth and turn their color interely into red, avoiding aliens, exploding bricks and getting items.

I've made this game when I was 12-13 years old, I wanted something simple that would reminds the times of the early 80s arcades, it's not the greatest game ever, but it introduced me to the programming world and I am really proud of it.
